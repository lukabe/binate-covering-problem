# Binate and unate covering problem
Binate Covering Problem (BCP) and Unate Covering Problem (UCP) are issues that describe the determination of the minimum coverage of the set. BCP and UCP belong to the group of NP-hard issues.

In BCP a set for coverage is filled with elements from the set {1, -1, 0} and in UCP from the set {1, 0}.

## Usage
Using my application you can solve the coverage of a set of any size:
* give X and Y of a set,
* press *Generate* button to generate an empty set,
* fill a set with elements for BCP or UCP,
* press *Solve* button to get solution.

In addition to the final result we'll get a step by step solution.
